Refer to the `files_for_lab/we_fn_use_c_marketing_customer_value_analysis.csv` dataset.

### Instructions

1. Get the numerical variables from our dataset.
2. Check using a distribution plot if the variables fit the theoretical normal or exponential distribution.
3. Check if any of the transformations (log-transform, etc.) we have seen up to this point changes the result.
